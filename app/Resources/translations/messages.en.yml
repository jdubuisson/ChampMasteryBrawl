cmb.help.championmastery.title: 'What is the Champion Mastery ?'
cmb.help.championmastery.content: 'This is a score computed by Riot. After each (eligible) game you play with a champion, this champion''s mastery increases. In "ChampMastery : Brawl", we use this mastery to determine who is the strongest.'
cmb.help.riot-account.title: 'Is my Riot/League of Legends account safe ?'
cmb.help.riot-account.content: 'Yes : we use the official Riot Games API to retrieve the public data associated with a summoner as well as the static champion data. We will never ask for your password or anything shady.'
cmb.help.summoner.title: 'Does that mean anyone can pretend to be any summoner ?'
cmb.help.summoner.content: 'Actually... yes. But it is ok : multiple accounts can use the same summoner. This is why we ask for a username so you can tell your friends who you really are. On the plus side, it means you can use a super powerful Challenger account if you know their summoner name and region - without preventing this Challenger player the ability to play "ChampMastery : Brawl".'
cmb.help.region.title: 'Does this work with any region/server ?'
cmb.help.region.content: 'Yes, the Riot Games API allows us to get data based on the region/server. Just tell us your region when activating your account, and everything will be fine.'
cmb.help.win.title: 'How can I win in this game ?'
cmb.help.win.content: 'Each team consists of 5 champions. A brawl is actually 5 duels : champion1 VS champion1, champion2 VS champion2 and so on. IF you lose a brawl, look for the mastery score (CMP) of your champions and your opponent''s champions. Try re-ordering them : you can afford to lose 2 duels if you win the other 3. However, the best way to improve is to play League of Legends : increase your mastery with every champion and conquer the game !'
